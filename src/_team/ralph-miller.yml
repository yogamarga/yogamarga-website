bio:
  Wandering far and wide in search of greater meaning, Ralph has been a
  student of many disciplines, and sat at the feet of many a marketing
  guru in order to become a professional seo consultant. By attaining the secrets of <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>
  and mastering the art of <abbr title="Search Engine Marketing">SEM</abbr>,
  Ralph has worked on over 80 Internet marketing campaigns and helped
  several Fortune 500 companies propel their sites to the top of the
  search engines.


  In addition to being an <a href="http://www.semmys.org/2010/reputation-management-2010-winner/">award winning writer</a>,
  Ralph's creative mind allows him to see the hidden opportunities for your
  business to create great content, earn (not build) quality backlinks, and
  achieve higher search engine ranking. That's why he's our professional seo consultant.

  Oh yeah, he does have a formal education (read as MBA). But we all know what
  that and two dollars will buy you at a coffeeshop... that's right... a cup of
  green tea (his drink of choice when coworking in Phoenix).
