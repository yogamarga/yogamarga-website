bio:
  Curtis is a ruby developer who holds a MS in Computer Science, with an emphasis on Software Engineering. This intense study of the process by which software is
  created led him to the Agile Methodology, which is the basis of
  Flatterline's approach to software development.


  He has been developing software for over 10 years and has worked on
  large, distributed systems for the US Navy, behavioral health EHR
  systems and large-scale CMS, as well as dozens of small startup ideas.


  He found his true passion developing web applications using the Ruby
  programming language and hasnâ€™t looked back since.
